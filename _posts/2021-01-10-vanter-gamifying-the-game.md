So, you have discovered "The game". You know the vocabulary and the rules. You have read books and articles, and watched tens of videos... but you still don't have the success that all those products promise. Why!?

It's nearly impossible to learn a skill by reading about it. Theory helps you identify and correct mistakes, but you still have to make those mistakes.

If you have ever played a sport, you probably know what I'm talking about. An expert could tell you exactly how to swing a raquet, but when you try it yourself, it doesn't have the same effect.

In the other hand, if you know the theory and try swinging a raquet, you might be able to identify what you did wrong after a bad swing. Repeat this process enough times and eventually you will be able to swing correctly without even having to think about it.

Pick up works the same way. It's good to know the theory, so you can identify what went wrong after an approach, but you have to approach. Our body and our mind need to be able to feel a good approach vs a bad one, knowing it is not enough.

This is the reason I created Vantter.

I know I have to go out and practice, but sometimes it's hard to get the motivation.

Vantter let's you connect with friends around the world so you can keep each other accountable. You earn points depending on how much you practice. You can also track your progress so you can see how you are improving over time.

The goal of Vantter is to give you the motivation you need to get out, practice and have fun while you do it.

Let me know what you think.
